# Comparative Study of Facial Detection Algorithms
- Researched Haars Cascade, MTCNN, Dlib, DNN, RetinaFace, and HOG facial detection algorithms in efforts to compare their performances. 
- Implemented all algorithms in three mediums: photos, videos, and live-stream videos.
- **Goal:** To determine the performance of currently used facial detection algorithms, highlighting the benefits and limitations of each in different situations
